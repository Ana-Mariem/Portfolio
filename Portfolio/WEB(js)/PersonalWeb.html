            <p>Since I was little I have always enjoyed drawing, as well as colors and observing my surroundings. 
                Growing up I became very interested in cinema and the endless possibilities it offered to create stories and new worlds. 
                So, digital animation seemed like a great idea to me; combining something I enjoyed with technology.
                My goal as a future professional is to be able to work in a film studio or in the production of a video game, 
                being able to contribute with my ideas and skills in the creation of something that people can enjoy.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Chaos Walking</strong> is a dystopian series that follows the journey of a boy living in a world where thoughts are audible, and he discovers a shocking truth about his town and himself.</p>
            <p><b>My humble opinion:</b>
                It is one of the sagas that has captivated me the most, it has many twists and turns that you don't see coming and you end up hating and loving the characters, recommended.
                 (not so recommended the movie though heh. It's good... but not that much ü§®)</p>

            <p><strong>Aura</strong> is a classic Mexican novel that mixes mystery, supernatural elements, and romance, where a young man encounters a strange woman living with her elderly aunt.</p>
            <p><b>General opinions:</b>
                It's very strange, but it's very good... you know? I read it because my mom lent it to me and after only 65 pages I was very confused but I enjoyed a great mystery story. üëç</p>

            <p><strong>Selenofilia</strong> Selenophilia? It talks about love and hate, society and individualism, having everything and owning nothing, reality and fiction. A world of opposite situations and contradictory lives that are submerged in a network of plots that seek a common point.</p>
            <p><b>More opinions:</b> I usually read more fantasy or fiction things far from reality, in this case Selenophilia falls into a fairly normal context we could say... even so I think it's worth it, it's one of the books I've enjoyed the most and finished the fastest (should I read it again..? yeah...) </p>
